# Installation

## Installation on Windows

Visit <http://www.python.org/download/> and download the latest version. The installation is just like any other Windows-based software.

Caution

:   When you are given the option of unchecking any "optional" components, don't uncheck any.

### DOS Prompt

If you want to be able to use Python from the Windows command line i.e. the DOS prompt, then you need to set the PATH variable appropriately.

For Windows 2000, XP, 2003 , click on `Control Panel` --- `System` --- `Advanced` --- `Environment Variables`. Click on the variable named `PATH` in the 'System Variables' section, then select `Edit` and add `;C:\Python33` (please verify that this folder exists, it will be different for newer versions of Python) to the end of what is already there. Of course, use the appropriate directory name.

For older versions of Windows, open the file `C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT` and add the line '`PATH=%PATH%;C:\Python33`' (without the quotes) and restart the system. For Windows NT, use the `AUTOEXEC.NT` file.

For Windows Vista:

#. Click Start and choose Control Panel
#. Click System, on the right you’ll see “View basic information about your computer”
#. On the left is a list of tasks, the last of which is “Advanced system settings.” Click that.
#. The Advanced tab of the System Properties dialog box is shown. Click the Environment Variables button on the bottom right.
#. In the lower box titled “System Variables” scroll down to Path and click the Edit button.
#. Change your path as need be.
#. Restart your system. Vista didn’t pick up the system path environment variable change until I restarted.

For Windows 7:

#. Right click on Computer from your desktop and select properties or Click Start and choose Control Panel --- System and Security --- System. Click on Advanced system settings on the left and then click on the Advanced tab. At the bottom click on Environment Variables and under System variables, look for the PATH variable, select and then press Edit. 
#. Go to the end of the line under Variable value and append `;C:\Python33`.
#. If the value was `%SystemRoot%\system32;` It will now become `%SystemRoot%\system32;C:\Python33`
#. Click ok and you are done. No restart is required.

### Running Python prompt on Windows

For Windows users, you can run the interpreter in the command line if you have [set the `PATH` variable appropriately](#dos-prompt).

To open the terminal in Windows, click the start button and click 'Run'. In the dialog box, type `cmd` and press enter key.

Then, type `python3 -V` and ensure there are no errors.

## Installation on Mac OS X

For Mac OS X users, open the terminal by pressing `Command+Space` keys (to open Spotlight search), type `Terminal` and press enter key.

Install [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) by running:

~~~
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSkL raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"
~~~

Then install Python 3 using:

~~~
brew install python3
~~~

Now, run `python3 -V` and ensure there are no errors.

## Installation on Linux

For Linux users, open the terminal by opening the `Terminal` application or by pressing `Alt + F2` and entering `gnome-terminal`. If that doesn't work, please refer the documentation or forums of your particular Linux distribution.

Next, we have to install the `python3` package. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use [`sudo apt-get install python3`](http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=python3&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all). Please check the documentation or forums of the Linux distribution that you have installed for the correct package manager command to run.

Once you have finished the installation, run the `python3 -V` command in a shell and you should see the version of Python on the screen:

~~~
$ python3 -V
Python 3.3.0
~~~

Note

:   `$` is the prompt of the shell. It will be different for you depending on the settings of the operating system on your computer, hence I will indicate the prompt by just the `$` symbol.

Default in new versions of your distribution?

:   Newer distributions such as [Ubuntu 12.10 are making Python 3 the default version](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Python/3), so check if it is already installed.

## Summary

From now on, we will assume that you have Python 3 installed on your system.

Next, we will write our first Python 3 program.
